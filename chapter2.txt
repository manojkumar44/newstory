This is chapter2.txt file, and we continue adding some more
text here for testing purposes. We have already learned how
to stage a file in the (master) github repository on our
desktop folder named 'newstory'.

We stage a file by typing:

git add <file>

and then to commit we simply use:

git commit -m "add message describing what was changed,
but in present tense"

One again, that silly alien has got into this folder and edited 
my chapter2.txt file. I cannot believe its audacity to do this.

This extra line is a contribution to this chapter by MrManoj1978. He added this line.
